about:
  historyText: "The big band was founded in March 2009, when we became independent
    from Prof. Švejcar Elementary School in Prague 4, where we operated as a
    school band. The founding members were the Horáček brothers: Miroslav, Jakub
    and Zdeněk, all graduates of Adolf Voborský Art School. Until April 2013,
    Miroslav Horáček was the bandleader, after which his younger brother Jakub
    Horáček took over for nine years. Since January 2022, the orchestra has been
    led by Petr Martišek and Štěpánka Tomášová. For many years, our home venue
    was the U Staré paní jazz club in the Old Town, which we said goodbye to in
    November 2016. An interesting event in 2017 was a charity concert on
    Střelecký Island, where Matěj Ruppert sang with us. In 2017 we also
    participated in the Polenský Swing Festival."
  heading: About Us
  mainText: Horáček Swing Orchestra is a Prague-based big band playing swing, film
    and dance music. However, we are not genre-limited and in our repertoire you
    will also find rock and pop hits arranged for big band. Comprising a
    complete instrumental section and both male and female lead vocals, the
    orchestra frequently collaborates with guest vocalists to deliver intricate
    five-part harmonies from the stage. We organize our own concerts and dance
    evenings, most often in Vinohrady Brewery or Theatre za Plotem, but we try
    to discover new venues as well. We also gladly play at balls, corporate
    events or weddings. We are not a professional ensemble, but we love playing
    and we are a reliable, friendly collective of enthusiasts.

  eventPerformanceParagraph1: We'd be happy to play at your ball, corporate event,
    wedding or other occasion. To get an idea of what we can play for you, check
    out our [repertoire](/repertoar). We're also happy to rehearse a small
    number of your favorite songs by request, but arrangements need to be made
    well in advance. Early booking is also important to ensure all musicians are
    available and we can perform at our best. Three months in advance is usually
    enough, one month is borderline.

  eventPerformanceParagraph2: Our great advantage is that we have our own
    equipment and sound engineer, who is Kuba Horáček, our former bandleader.
    But we are of course also able to work with your chosen sound engineer.
